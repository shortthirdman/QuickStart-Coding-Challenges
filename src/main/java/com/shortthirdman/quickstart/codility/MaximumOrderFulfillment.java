/**
 * A technology company announced that a new supply of P monitors would soon be available at their store.
 * There were N orders (numbered from 0 to N-1) placed by customers who wanted to buy those monitors.
 * The K-th order has to be delivered to a location at distance D[K] from the store and is for exactly C[K] monitors.
 * Now the time has come for the monitors to be delivered. The orders will be fulfilled one by one. To minimize the shipping time,
 * it has been decided that the deliveries will be made in order of increasing distance from the store.
 * If there are many customers at the same distance, they can be processed in any order.
 * Monitors to more distant customers will be delivered only once all orders to customers closer to the store have already been fulfilled.
 * What is the maximum total number of orders that can be fulfilled?
