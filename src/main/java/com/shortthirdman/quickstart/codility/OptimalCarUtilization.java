/**
 * A group of friends is going on holiday together. They have come to a meeting point (the start of the journey)
 * using N cars. There are <code>P[K]</code> people and <code>S[K]</code> seats in the K-th car for K in range <code>[0...N-1]</code>.
 * Some of the seats in the cars may be free, so it is possible for some of the friends to change the car they are in.
 * The friends have decided that, in order to be ecological, they will leave some cars parked at the meeting point
 * and travel with as few cars as possible.
