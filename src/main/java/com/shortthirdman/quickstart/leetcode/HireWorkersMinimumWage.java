/**
 * <b>Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers</b><br/>
 * There are N workers. The i-th worker has a <code>quality[i]</code> and a minimum wage expectation <code>wage[i]</code>.<br/>
 *
 * Now we want to hire exactly K workers to form a paid group. When hiring a group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:<br/>
 * 1. Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.<br/>
 * 2. Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.<br/>
 *
 * Return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.<br/>
