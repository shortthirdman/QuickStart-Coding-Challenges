/**
 * There are n people standing in a line labeled from <code>1 to n</code>. The first person in the line is holding a pillow initially.
 * Every second, the person holding the pillow passes it to the next person standing in the line. Once the pillow reaches the end of the line,
 * the direction changes, and people continue passing the pillow in the opposite direction.
 * <br></br>
 * For example, once the pillow reaches the <code>nth</code> person they pass it to the <code>n - 1th</code> person,
 * then to the <code>n - 2th</code> person and so on.
 * Given the two positive integers <code>n</code> and <code>time</code>, return the <b>index</b> of the person holding the pillow
 * after <b>time</b> seconds.
