 * <code>H[i]</code> is the height of the wall from <code>i to i+1</code> meters to the right of its left end.

 * In particular, <code>H[0]</code> is the height of the wall's left end and <code>H[N−1]</code> is the height of the wall's right end.
 * The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides of such blocks are rectangular).
